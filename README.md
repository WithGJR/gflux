# gflux - A React+Flux Structure Generator

## Installation

``` bash
go get -u -x github.com/WithGJR/gflux
```

## About this generator

gflux is a generator help you generate the basic react+flux(with webpack) structure.

It equips with `babel-loader` and `react-hot-loader` by default. 

The reason I didn't write this generator in Javascript is that I like Golang more than Javascript. (And also because I'm more familiar with Golnag instead of Javascript.)

## Usage

``` bash
gflux [options]
```

## Options

- `-skip-install` : Skip executing `npm install`
